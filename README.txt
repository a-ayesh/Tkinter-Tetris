NOTE:
-Ensure that capslock is off
-There is a chance that depending on your screen size, the text may not be in its ideal position
-You can also trigger our wiggle easter egg by spamming the rotate key (w or up arrow)

THINGS NOT TO DO:
1) After using the bosskey and opening brownie recipe, do not close the brownie recipe window as it also closes the game. 
   Instead minimize the brownie recipe and open the game manually.
2) Do not rotate shapes at the very last second. This causes an error with the grid system and can either:
   - Cause the shape to dissapear
   - Cause the game to crash if at the bottom row
